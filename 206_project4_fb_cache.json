This 3,000 square foot loft ,just blocks from Bryant Park, simply offered the venue for shenanigans. Why not invite all of our friends to a party with its own floor(a place where the event manager said \"You can be as loud as you'd like\" since all other floors are under construction)?\n\nFor the low low price of $30 you will be getting access to a newly renovated loft with a 20x20 foot projector to watch the ball drop on! The whole space has wifi(if you routinely run out of data) and surround sound speakers(even in the bathrooms)! \n\nNot sure what your alcohol situation is? We even solved that.. kind of! You can bring your own alcohol or you can take advantage of the bartender we have rented for the evening! We even got the venue to throw in a free drink voucher for everyone in attendance. There is also a rumor that those who pay earlier will have first access to extra drink vouchers(Joey told Isobel and he got the green light from the venue so its basically the bible).\n\nYou and all of your friends are welcome just ask the hosts to add them to the event. We invited you because somewhere along the way we became friends so we trust you to invite those who will maintain a certain level of ratchetry that is tasteful. \n\nThe earlier you get there the more time you have to make poor decisions, and the greater the likelihood you will get a parking spot! Wear something sparkly, we will be dressed to be found in a semi lit smoky room easily. If you have any questions feel free to message either of us.\n\nThis event can be paid for through venmo, snapchat, or chase quickpay(No this event was not an elaborate excuse for me to advertise my snapchat you haters).", "end_time": "2018-01-01T03:00:00-0500", "name": "JoeyXIsobel NYC NYE Loft Party: 2017 SCAMMED ME", "place": {"name": "New York, NY", "location": {"city": "New York", "country": "United States", "latitude": 40.7535, "longitude": -73.9888, "state": "NY", "zip": "10018"}, "id": "212443158846108"}, "start_time": "2017-12-31T22:00:00-0500", "id": "156400671544203"}, {"description": "2018 is nearly here...\n\nand so are the parties!

This year dinner will be offered in two formats: take-out and restaurant style dine-in. Cash bar available. Take-out dinners available from 4pm - 6pm; restaurant style dine-in begins at 6pm.\nPre-booked tickets will be available at the SPCA: take-out dinner tickets $15 and dine-in dinner tickets $20 each. There will be a $5 increase for day-of purchases and children 13 and under will be $10 all around.

Proceeds will go toward funding spay/neuter surgeries for pit mixes/large breed dogs and our feral cat TNR (trap, neuter, and release) program. \n\nIn 2016, our spay and neuter efforts totaled 2,126 dogs and cats.  We could not have made this impact without the support of the community.
